							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<p>
									<b>Sheffield Royal Society for the Blind</b> (SRSB) is one of Sheffield's oldest independent charities,
									with a rich history dating back to 1860.
								</p>
								<p>
									The charity was founded by Eliza Harrison in memory of her sister Ann who had empathy for blind people.
									Their primary aim was to provide opportunities and support and employment for blind individuals.
									Their first workshops opened on the 17th September 1860 on West Street, marking the beginning of the charity.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Harrison sisters lived in Weston House (now Weston Park Museum) with their father.
									Upon selling this to the council, they were provided with the money to set up SRSB.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>1879</b> The school for the blind opened on Manchester Road.
											This school was later attended by Lord David Blunkett.
										</li>
										<li><b>1899</b> Overend cottages are opened in Crosspool providing independent living for blind people.</li>
										<li><b>1935</b> Cairn Home opens in Crosspool.</li>
										<li><b>1939</b> The Mappin Street building opens, providing a hub for entertainment.</li>
										<li><b>2009</b> A new building was built replacing the old one.</li>
										<li><b>2017</b> SRSB extends its services to Rotherham as Rotherham Sight and Sound (RSS).</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Today the SRSB and RSS continue to provide support and friendship
									to folks in the Sheffield and Rotherham areas.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Royal National Institute of Blind People</b> (RNIB) is a national charity which also
									provides outstanding support for blind and partially sighted people.
									Many people think we are the same charity and we often receive donations made out to RNIB.
									In-fact, like Guide Dogs or Deaf Blind UK, we are all quite separate.

									A great success!
									Those of you who unfortunately couldn't make it missed a treat.
								</p>
								<p>
									The weather was kind, the garden was looking spectacular, and the atmosphere was very lively and upbeat.
									So thanks to Mike for being such a generous and enthusiastic host, he certainly kept us on our toes with the organisation.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks also to the members of the Abbeydale Rotary club for their generous support with advance publicity, practicalities and administration.
									Thank you to Mike's family and friends who helped on the day and to Nicola for her supreme efficiency in the kitchen.
									I've never seen anyone produce so many glasses of pimms so fast, with tea and coffee on the boil at the same time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also thanks to everyone who contributed to the refreshments, I heard lots of appreciative compliments about the cakes.
									Finally, thank you to everyone who attended and made the afternoon such a convivial gathering, it was a really feel-good event.
								</p>
								<p>
									We made a profit of just over £500, a fantastic result.

								<p>
									Sometimes we have to turn down VI's if there are not enough guides for that particular walk.
									This is never personal - we are working hard to recruit new guides so our VI's are never turned down for a walk.
								</p>
								<p>
									Judith has set up a Facebook page for our group to send her any photos, videos, etc, hopefully to recruit new guides.
									Contact details are
									<a href="mailto:judemorton56@gmail.com">judemorton56@gmail.com</a> or

									<br>
									Also not forgetting our web site managed by James Percival.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also it is most important to contact Martin by the date specified for that particular walk.
									This gives Martin time to try to find more guides to come along, sometimes forgetting to put their names down.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ideally we would like to have 2 guides for each VI but this is not possible so we always have 2 to 3 spare guides
									to give other guides who find themselves guiding most of the day a rest.

								<p>
									Mike Jackson MBE joined our group in 2000 not long after it had started.
								</p>
								<p>
									He soon became a popular character, and as well as our bi-monthly walks with the Peak Park Rangers he arranged the alternative walk on Thursdays.
									This ensured we now had a walk each week in our schedule.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mike certainly pushed the envelope, taking blind members with guides to places we could only imagine as blind people.
									These walks were not for the faint hearted.<br>
									He received his MBE for services in the community, showcasing his garden in Dore each year,
									mountain rescue, and also a member of the Rotary club.
								</p>
								<p>
									The star of our group must be Betsy Wilson however who is no longer with us,
									who when the group began was instrumental in helping the Committee get started,
									becoming our first Chair, starting the newsletter,
									and pushing the group by telling everyone who would listen when out walking about the SVIWG.

								<p>
									Further to my first history memories I have been asked if I can think of any other.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have had many wonderful guides and still have passing through our group.<br>
									Some names which left their mark are Jean and Gordon Worthington who joined around one year after the group started.
									They encouraged the fourth Sunday walk and also helped to get the committee rolling.
									Also they took the group on their first three holidays all on public transport.
									The first being the Isle of Wight and the next two to Teignmouth on the train.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another memorable holiday was to Austria on a walking trip - this was arranged by a VI member.
								</p>
								<p>
									After that Hilary Myers, a VI, took on the role and arranged many holidays with great precision leaving no stone unturned.
									By now the holiday group had grown to around 30 or so, which was no mean feat.
								</p>
								<p>
									Other memorable guides were Peter and Brenda Sunderland and Jack Burling
									who were amongst the first guides with the Ramblers to step up and come out with our group.
								</p>
								<p>
									John Bater, a VI, came along and was a great addition as he had an encyclopaedic knowledge of our countryside and further,
									and as his sight was not too bad he could also lead walks.
								</p>
								<p>
									Not forgetting Eric Andrews, a VI, but also an adventurer who arranged many fundraising events;
									Walking up Ben Nevis, Snowdon, and Scafell Pike, and also Tandem riding at the Manchester Velodrome.
								</p>
								<p>
									Steve Brown also arranged to cross the sands at Morecambe Bay.

								<h3 class="card-title fs-5">OUR HISTORY</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<p>
									As we enter our 25th year of the SVIWG many new members often ask how this unique group started.
								</p>
								<p>
									It started very small in the year 2000 when Ted Ellerton, a seasoned Rambler, a very hard-core walker,
									was driving home one Saturday night looking forward to his Sunday Ramble with the Ramblers.
								</p>
								<p>
									Upon waking Sunday morning Ted was completely blind due to a detached retina.<br>
									Ted only had one good eye, not sure but I think his other retina had detached some years back.<br>
									The hospital could not attach it again so he was left to pick up the pieces.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ted lived alone. Eventually he was put in touch with Jill Thompson, a Rehabilitation Officer at Howden House.<br>
									She asked Ted what he would like to do and he said he would still like to Ramble.
								</p>
								<p>
									Jill took Ted to a meeting with the Ramblers and asked if anyone would help Ted and be a guide when out walking.<br>
									Jack Burling, Peter and Brenda Sunderland said they would and along with Jill and another VI set off on their first walk.<br>
									It rained all day, very muddy - what a start - but it did not put them off as they were used to it, being keen Ramblers.
								</p>
								<p>
									Through word of mouth other Guides appeared and the group was advertised through various means and quickly it started to grow.
									Betsy joined soon after and as she was also a keen Rambler and felt she could no longer go with the Ramblers she was delighted
									and made it her mission to make it successful.
								</p>
								<p>
									We only had the second Wednesday walk then and Jill used to send out the information of where the walk would be going
									all in print and Braille as not many people had email addresses then let alone computers where VI's could listen
									as the screen was read out to them.
								</p>
								<p>
									Later a fourth Sunday walk was started and the Thursday bi-monthly walk with the Rangers.
									This meant a newsletter had to be produced which Betsy set to,
									taking it on to a CD when finished for SRSB to produce and send out to all members.<br>
									Betsy and husband Colin then, for those who wanted, produced the newsletter on cassette tape at home with Colin patiently reading out for us.
								</p>
								<p>
									Technology took over and most members receive the newsletter by email.
								</p>
								<p>
									I think this group would not have happened if Ted had not been known by the Ramblers.<br>
									I know they have been approached by a VI who is younger and wants to walk with people near her own age and they pointed her in our direction.
									She has been but she is very fit and it was not what she wanted.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ted died some years ago and Jill took early retirement and now lives in Scotland but still in contact.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is a tribute to Ted and Jill that our group is still going. Thank you both I am sure from all our VI's.

									Just wanted to express my gratitude and appreciation to all our walk leaders and guides for all the Guided walks this year.<br>
									I haven't been on as many as I would have liked as we seem to have had a few holidays and many DBUK commitments this year but as always,
									the walks and the company have been great.
								</p>
								<p>	
									I also appreciate that the SVIWG only works as well as it does because of our volunteers on the committee so on behalf of all the VIPs
									would also like to thank you for all the hard work behind the scenes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks so much everyone hope you have a really happy Christmas and a healthy and happy New Year.

							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<b>Something Old, Something New, Experience by Carol Adams</b><br>
								<br>
								<p>
									I wouldn't say I'm scared, I wouldn't say I'm not.
									Memories of the past linger, rehearsing lines, adrenaline shot, I'm older now, my memory not what it used to be,
									Excitement in meeting new people, wondering what's next for me, It seemed so far off at first and then wow -
									So many more lines than I expected, right now.
								</p>
								<p>
									On reflection, I wonder if I'll learn them all in time,
									Something new to dive into, but oh, will I shine?
									Will I have to dance or sing, make the audience ring? It's a wedding scene, so will there be bling?
									A lot on my mind - can I still stand tall, After surgery, and pull it off at all?
								</p>
								<p>
									At first, I doubt myself, but then I take a stand, Rehearsals begin, lines spoken, all carefully planned.
									I hope to keep everything authentic and true, Looking forward to knowing my lines through and through,
									Then there are cues to remember, every one, How many times will I pour my soul into this run?
								</p>
								<p>
									Today is a day of rest, tomorrow's the final prep, Opening night looms and I've got one last step.
									We started in July, now the end is near, Just a week to go, and we'll give it all here,
									The stage is set, the people I've met - What will the critics say, what will we get?
								</p>
								<p>
									We hope for success in every show and pray for applause from row to row.
									I wonder about emotions, seeking approval high,
									The lines in my head, will they stick when I try?
									We all worry about missing a cue but the audience won't know, they haven't a clue.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here's just one song but I won't be the singer, My lines are rehearsed, I won't be a winger,
									I'm playing a registrar - does this role fit me? I'll give it my best and hope for victory.
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm so tired I could sleep for a week but I carry on, though rest seems bleak,
									The gym is my refuge at dawn's early light, Before trying to sleep, though it's still a fight.
								</p>
								<p>
									The dress rehearsal was a bit of a flop, Missing lines and prop mishaps that just won't stop,
									Are we ready for this, is time on our side? But then adrenaline kicks in and I'm along for the ride.
								</p>
								<p>
									The audiences are plenty, they clap as we leave, There's a buzz backstage, no time to grieve.
									At our first party, everyone craves more but there's still work to do, still things to explore.
								</p>
								<p>
									Every day's different, changes are made, Lines and scenes cut, to make the grade,
									Suddenly, confidence rises and I find my stride, It's a great show, with pride I confide.
								</p>
								<p>
									The audience laughs, and I make some cry, Despite any noise, we don't let it die,
									At last, it's here - we've made it through, Knowing 600 people have watched our debut.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now it's all over, no more lines to learn, We scream, shout, and take our turn,
									The adrenaline fades, and I finally sleep, With memories of this time, forever to keep.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks to all for their support - I'm worn out but proud, Proud I did it, that I made it, I say aloud,
									Proud of this unforgettable scene, Standing on stage, feeling serene, I owned it, just like the rest, That registrar role, I gave it my best.
