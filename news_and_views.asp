									Dear Friends.
								</p>
								<p>
									By the time you read this newsletter we shall (hopefully) be getting settled into our new home in Woody Point, Queensland.
								</p>
								<p>
									I have been a guide with SVIWG for 20 plus years, it has been one of the best things I have ever done.
									I've met some incredible folks and made good friends (you know who you are) along the way.
								</p>
								<p>
									I shall miss your friendship, fun and sometimes challenges. Wishing everyone health and happiness.
								</p>

								Regards, Janet Murphy.

									It is with regret to have to tell you Paul Starkey, an old friend to our group, died in September.
								</p>
								<p>
									Paul was one of our first guides and he was always good fun to walk with.
									Paul did not have good health for many years.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our condolences to his family and friends and to those who remember him in our group.

							<div class="card-body">
								<p>
									A big thank you to all of our lovely guides who gave up their morning to attend a training day with Alison Anthony.
									Alison is a senior Re-hab trainer at Howden House.
								</p>
								<p>
									Alison said what a lovely group it was and not too serious we had laughs along the way.
								</p>
								<p>
									We will hold another one sometime next year with new potential guides (here's hoping) also if anyone need a re-fresher.
									Meanwhile we always put our training videos in the newsletter if you need a refresh. Thank you all.
