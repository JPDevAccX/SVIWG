									Mike Jackson MBE joined our group in 2000 not long after it had started.
								</p>
								<p>
									He soon became a popular character, and as well as our bi-monthly walks with the Peak Park Rangers he arranged the alternative walk on Thursdays.
									This ensured we now had a walk each week in our schedule.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mike certainly pushed the envelope, taking blind members with guides to places we could only imagine as blind people.
									These walks were not for the faint hearted.<br>
									He received his MBE for services in the community, showcasing his garden in Dore each year,
									mountain rescue, and also a member of the Rotary club.
								</p>
								<p>
									The star of our group must be Betsy Wilson however who is no longer with us,
									who when the group began was instrumental in helping the Committee get started,
									becoming our first Chair, starting the newsletter,
									and pushing the group by telling everyone who would listen when out walking about the SVIWG.

								<p>
									Further to my first history memories I have been asked if I can think of any other.
								</p>
								<p>
									We have had many wonderful guides and still have passing through our group.<br>
									Some names which left their mark are Jean and Gordon Worthington who joined around one year after the group started.
									They encouraged the fourth Sunday walk and also helped to get the committee rolling.
									Also they took the group on their first three holidays all on public transport.
									The first being the Isle of Wight and the next two to Teignmouth on the train.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another memorable holiday was to Austria on a walking trip - this was arranged by a VI member.
								</p>
								<p>
									After that Hilary Myers, a VI, took on the role and arranged many holidays with great precision leaving no stone unturned.
									By now the holiday group had grown to around 30 or so, which was no mean feat.
								</p>
								<p>
									Other memorable guides were Peter and Brenda Sunderland and Jack Burling
									who were amongst the first guides with the Ramblers to step up and come out with our group.
								</p>
								<p>
									John Bater, a VI, came along and was a great addition as he had an encyclopaedic knowledge of our countryside and further,
									and as his sight was not too bad he could also lead walks.
								</p>
								<p>
									Not forgetting Eric Andrews, a VI, but also an adventurer who arranged many fundraising events;
									Walking up Ben Nevis, Snowdon, and Scafell Pike, and also Tandem riding at the Manchester Velodrome.
								</p>
								<p>
									Steve Brown also arranged to cross the sands at Morecambe Bay.

									We have another group with Rotherham Sight and Sound, a subsidiary of SRSB which meets on the first Thursday each month to walk in Rotherham.

								<h3 class="card-title fs-5">OUR HISTORY</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<p>
									As we enter our 25th year of the SVIWG many new members often ask how this unique group started.
								</p>
								<p>
									It started very small in the year 2000 when Ted Ellerton, a seasoned Rambler, a very hard-core walker,
									was driving home one Saturday night looking forward to his Sunday Ramble with the Ramblers.
								</p>
								<p>
									Upon waking Sunday morning Ted was completely blind due to a detached retina.<br>
									Ted only had one good eye, not sure but I think his other retina had detached some years back.<br>
									The hospital could not attach it again so he was left to pick up the pieces.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ted lived alone. Eventually he was put in touch with Jill Thompson, a Rehabilitation Officer at Howden House.<br>
									She asked Ted what he would like to do and he said he would still like to Ramble.
								</p>
								<p>
									Jill took Ted to a meeting with the Ramblers and asked if anyone would help Ted and be a guide when out walking.<br>
									Jack Burling, Peter and Brenda Sunderland said they would and along with Jill and another VI set off on their first walk.<br>
									It rained all day, very muddy - what a start - but it did not put them off as they were used to it, being keen Ramblers.
								</p>
								<p>
									Through word of mouth other Guides appeared and the group was advertised through various means and quickly it started to grow.
									Betsy joined soon after and as she was also a keen Rambler and felt she could no longer go with the Ramblers she was delighted
									and made it her mission to make it successful.
								</p>
								<p>
									We only had the second Wednesday walk then and Jill used to send out the information of where the walk would be going
									all in print and Braille as not many people had email addresses then let alone computers where VI's could listen
									as the screen was read out to them.
								</p>
								<p>
									Later a fourth Sunday walk was started and the Thursday bi-monthly walk with the Rangers.
									This meant a newsletter had to be produced which Betsy set to,
									taking it on to a CD when finished for SRSB to produce and send out to all members.<br>
									Betsy and husband Colin then, for those who wanted, produced the newsletter on cassette tape at home with Colin patiently reading out for us.
								</p>
								<p>
									Technology took over and most members receive the newsletter by email.
								</p>
								<p>
									I think this group would not have happened if Ted had not been known by the Ramblers.<br>
									I know they have been approached by a VI who is younger and wants to walk with people near her own age and they pointed her in our direction.
									She has been but she is very fit and it was not what she wanted.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ted died some years ago and Jill took early retirement and now lives in Scotland but still in contact.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is a tribute to Ted and Jill that our group is still going. Thank you both I am sure from all our VI's.

								<p>
									Just wanted to express my gratitude and appreciation to all our walk leaders and guides for all the Guided walks this year.<br>
									I haven't been on as many as I would have liked as we seem to have had a few holidays and many DBUK commitments this year but as always,
									the walks and the company have been great.
								</p>
								<p>	
									I also appreciate that the SVIWG only works as well as it does because of our volunteers on the committee so on behalf of all the VIPs
									would also like to thank you for all the hard work behind the scenes.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks so much everyone hope you have a really happy Christmas and a healthy and happy New Year.
									Looking forward to all our walks in 2025.<br>
									Very best wishes.

							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<b>Something Old, Something New, Experience by Carol Adams</b><br>
								<br>
								<p>
									I wouldn't say I'm scared, I wouldn't say I'm not.
									Memories of the past linger, rehearsing lines, adrenaline shot, I'm older now, my memory not what it used to be,
									Excitement in meeting new people, wondering what's next for me, It seemed so far off at first and then wow -
									So many more lines than I expected, right now.
								</p>
								<p>
									On reflection, I wonder if I'll learn them all in time,
									Something new to dive into, but oh, will I shine?
									Will I have to dance or sing, make the audience ring? It's a wedding scene, so will there be bling?
									A lot on my mind - can I still stand tall, After surgery, and pull it off at all?
								</p>
								<p>
									At first, I doubt myself, but then I take a stand, Rehearsals begin, lines spoken, all carefully planned.
									I hope to keep everything authentic and true, Looking forward to knowing my lines through and through,
									Then there are cues to remember, every one, How many times will I pour my soul into this run?
								</p>
								<p>
									Today is a day of rest, tomorrow's the final prep, Opening night looms and I've got one last step.
									We started in July, now the end is near, Just a week to go, and we'll give it all here,
									The stage is set, the people I've met - What will the critics say, what will we get?
								</p>
								<p>
									We hope for success in every show and pray for applause from row to row.
									I wonder about emotions, seeking approval high,
									The lines in my head, will they stick when I try?
									We all worry about missing a cue but the audience won't know, they haven't a clue.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here's just one song but I won't be the singer, My lines are rehearsed, I won't be a winger,
									I'm playing a registrar - does this role fit me? I'll give it my best and hope for victory.
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm so tired I could sleep for a week but I carry on, though rest seems bleak,
									The gym is my refuge at dawn's early light, Before trying to sleep, though it's still a fight.
								</p>
								<p>
									The dress rehearsal was a bit of a flop, Missing lines and prop mishaps that just won't stop,
									Are we ready for this, is time on our side? But then adrenaline kicks in and I'm along for the ride.
								</p>
								<p>
									The audiences are plenty, they clap as we leave, There's a buzz backstage, no time to grieve.
									At our first party, everyone craves more but there's still work to do, still things to explore.
								</p>
								<p>
									Every day's different, changes are made, Lines and scenes cut, to make the grade,
									Suddenly, confidence rises and I find my stride, It's a great show, with pride I confide.
								</p>
								<p>
									The audience laughs, and I make some cry, Despite any noise, we don't let it die,
									At last, it's here - we've made it through, Knowing 600 people have watched our debut.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now it's all over, no more lines to learn, We scream, shout, and take our turn,
									The adrenaline fades, and I finally sleep, With memories of this time, forever to keep.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks to all for their support - I'm worn out but proud, Proud I did it, that I made it, I say aloud,
									Proud of this unforgettable scene, Standing on stage, feeling serene, I owned it, just like the rest, That registrar role, I gave it my best.

									David and Paul would like to thank all those members who came on the Tuesday walk on the 5th March.
									It was a fantastic turnout, there were 19 in total which is one of the highest we have had.
								</p>
								<p>
									There were eight VI's so we had enough guides.
									It was especially nice to see Mary and Ken.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was a nice day, the weather was kind, and although we had to change the walk due to the heavy rain we had just a few days before,
									it was a first Tuesday walk around Graves Park, Summerhouse and Cobnar Woods.

								<p>
									Congratulations to Mike Jackson who has received an MBE in the new
									year's honours list for services to the community.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mike said one of his greatest privileges was joining the SVIWG soon after the group started,
									leading a Bi-monthly walk taking VI's to places we never dreamed of
									and indeed VI's who had been long time ramblers and lost their sight
									later in life they never thought it would be possible again.
								</p>
								<p>
									The	memorable ones like Kinder Scout, Bleaklow and leading a party up	Snowdon.
									Mike was a warden on Kinder and we always knew we	were in safe hands.
								</p>
								<p>
									Well-deserved Mike on behalf of the SVIWG.

									A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE - Guides and VIP's alike, who went on our six day holiday in Anglesey.
									You were Marvellous. We had six lovely HOT days away with great companions.
									A special thanks must go to the five lovely people, our friends from Wales, Margaret, Peter, Helen, Steff and Angie
									who joined us and led us on different days, giving us six different and	interesting walks, we shall all remember.
								</p>
								<p>
									To Phil, our skilful Coach driver and friend, thank you for looking after us all so well, and getting us safely back each day.
									I'm looking forward to finding out what Margaret Patrick is planning for us next year in Northumberland.
									Thank you all for your support over the last 12 years of my arranging the groups walking holiday. My records show that the
									first time we met and were led by Margaret Norwood was on Tuesday 6th September in 2011.
									She led us on a 7 mile circular walk, from our Hotel in Betws-y-Coed.
