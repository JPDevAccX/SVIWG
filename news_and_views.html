								OUR HOLIDAY IN WALES - A Thank You From Hilary
							</div>
							<div class="card-body sviwg-ws-preline">
								A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE - Guides and VIs alike, who went on our six day holiday in Anglesey.
								You were Marvellous. We had six lovely HOT days away with great companions.
								A special thanks must go to the five lovely people, our friends from Wales, Margaret, Peter, Helen, Steff and Angie who joined us and led us on different days, giving us six different and	interesting walks, we shall all remember.
								
								To Phil, our skilful Coach driver and friend, thank you for looking after us all so well, and getting us safely back each day.
								I'm looking forward to finding out what Margaret Patrick is planning for us next year in Northumberland.
								Thank	you all for your support over the last 12 years of my arranging the groups walking holiday. My records show that the
								first time we met and were led by Margaret Norwood was on Tuesday 6th September in 2011.
								She led us on a 7 mile circular	walk, from our Hotel in Betws-y-Coed.

								GORDON WORTHINGTON - A SAD LOSS FOR OUR MEMBERS
							</div>
							<div class="card-body sviwg-ws-preline">
								I am very sorry to announce Gordon Worthington died Sunday 30th July at home with his family just after his 89th birthday.
								Gordon along with Jean joined our walking group just after it had started, and quickly got involved with the group.
								They started the fourth Sunday walk as we only had the Wednesday walk back then one walk per month and they were responsible for taking the group on their first holidays on public transport, not in the bespoke coach we have today.
								
								The first holiday being in the Isle of Wight with a coach company. Rod, who was with the group then, knew many walks around the Isle of Wight.
								After that, came two train trips to Teignmouth, and later in our cars to the Lake district.
								Gordon and Jean were also responsible for helping to set up the committee.
								Gordon was an excellent guide, becoming our No 1 guide. This was seconded by Betsy, which was praise indeed.
								His	dedication to guiding and to the group was outstanding, and he always said he did not feel right unless he had someone to guide, he loved it.

								Gordon also loved his garden and spent the afternoons in there when at home. He had lots of bird feeders and said he had to fill them up twice a day.
								He had a very long garden which kept him very busy. He loved the social side of our group, although he was a quiet man, he had a great presence.
								Gordon and Jean were married for 65 years and were a truly devoted couple hardly ever to be seen without one another.
								On behalf of the SVIWG we send our condolences to Jean, daughter Jacqueline and son Peter, their Grandchildren and their Great Grandchild.

								So lovely to have known you Gordon.

								MEMORIES OF OUR GORDON
							</div>
							<div class="card-body sviwg-ws-preline">
								I would like to share a funny story about Gordon and myself.

								I had arranged to meet Jean and Gordon for a walk but for some reason Jean could not make it. It was just the two of us.
								We had a nice walk and finished in the cafe at Norfolk Park. The chef is my neighbour's father, so I know him.
								I said, "hello Andrew this is my friend Gordon", straight away he said, "nowt to do with me, nowt to do with me".
								I looked at Gordon and said, "he thinks we are having it off". How we laughed a lovely memory.

								RIP my lovely kind caring friend, you will be reunited with George, Betsy and our John B....

								PETER BLACKWELL
							</div>
							<div class="card-body sviwg-ws-preline">
								I am sorry to inform our members about the sad loss of Peter Blackwell who died on Wednesday 19th January in hospital.
								Peter had a long-term illness but to those who knew him we would always see a cheerful chap on our walks.
								
								Peter had lots of interests and hobbies, one was collecting scrap from skips to sell for funds for the BBC's Children in
								Need. Also Peter and Kate were active in their community litter picking and organising boxes to go abroad for children.
								He also loved building things in their garden, suc as a small caravan for his Grandchildren to play in.
								
								Peter would arrive on walks with his shorts on and on his scooter. He also would wear his novelty hats, one which he
								seemed to favour was his "Davy Crockett Hat" which he wore on our 1st December Christmas walk at the Wadsley Jack.
								Peter also went to the Philippines on three occasions, helping to build orphanages and a playground. It was always a
								great pleasure when Peter and Kate turned up for a walk. Although, they did not come along as regularly as they used to
								due to Peter's poor health.
								
								On behalf of the SVIWG I would like to send our condolences to Kate and their family at this time.
								Peter's service of celebration will be at South Anston Methodist Church, Sheffield Road, S25 5DT on Saturday 5th February 1pm.

								A REMINDER OF LAST YEARS HOLIDAY
							</div>
							<div class="card-body sviwg-ws-preline">
								Twenty five members of the Sheffield walking group, ten visually impaired, fifteen guides and 3 guide dogs stayed for 4
								nights at the County Hotel in Kendal. The staff had not had a group our size staying before &amp with 10 of us being
								visually impaired they weren't sure what to expect - well they soon found out! The staff that served us were very
								friendly &amp; although quite busy always helped with a cheerful smile on their face.
								When we left to return home, the manager thanked us all for staying and said they had all learnt so much about visually
								impaired people. He was amazed how well we did, managing to move around the place better than some of their other
								sighted guests. He said we were always welcome to stay in his Hotel and hoped we would return again soon.
								I believe we made a lasting impression as we always do on our Holidays. Our thanks must go to our member Steve Brown,
								who travelled up to the Lakes to lead two lovely walks for us.
								
								Wednesday's walk was a circular one from Stavely, Cumbria.
								
								Thursdays walk, a little more challenging from Burneside back to Kendal.
								
								Our thanks also to David Kayley who was on holiday with us, for leading Friday's walk from Cartmel to Grange-over-sands.
								
								We had short, easier walks on the other 3 days. On Wednesdays started from Rydal Hall (home of the late William
								Wordsworth} to Grasmere. On Thursday we had a boat ride from Windermere to Ambleside and Ken went to the bridge to have
								a steer of the boat. Following the sail we walked around two thirds of Brotherswater then retraced our steps back to the
								start.
								
								We were treated to an air display over Brotherswater during our walk, by 3 Chinook helicopters, 6 Typhoons and 3 other
								Jets. I'm not sure what they were, but as the last one flew past the pilot banked the plane in a wave, showing it's
								underbelly. What a real treat that was!! On Friday the walk was around Brown Robin Nature reserve (a bit trickier than
								expected), then along the prom at Grange-over-sands. Thank you to Beewise, our Coach operator for allowing Phil who once
								again skilfully drove us to all our destinations. Thanks Phil for also leading the short walk on Friday, you're an
								indispensable member of the group now.
								
								When we left to return home, the manager thanked us all for staying and said they had all learnt so much about visually
								impaired people. He was amazed how well we did, managing to move around the place better than some of their other
								sighted guests. He said we were always welcome to stay in his Hotel and hoped we would return again soon.
								I believe we made a lasting impression as we always do on our Holidays. Our thanks must go to our member Steve Brown,
								who travelled up to the Lakes to lead two lovely walks for us.
								
								Don't forget to watch Michael Portillo's Railway Journeys programme when he's at Grange-over-sands, you never know we
								might be on the telly.
								
								My thanks to Eilleen, her brother, Mike and David K for their suggestion on these shorter walks. Also Derby, Tango and
								Dot I send a big Wuf Wuf. Thank you Janet, Eileen, Paul and Margaret for supporting with the morning and evening walks.
								Thanks to all the guides from the VI walkers,THANK YOU for your caring support that you gave us during our 4 days away,
								without you we could not have had this Holiday.
								
								It was a challenge getting this holiday underway, with one thing after another happening. We were all feeling
								apprehensive about how safe we would be as the virus made for much uncertainty. We all tried our best to keep each other
								safe. Well done everyone. Thank you for your kind messages and your support, I am happy everyone had a wonderful time.
								You are an exceptional group of people, kind, giving and fun to be with. This is one reason I always spend time trying
								to get the Holiday details just right, for all of us. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
								
								Would you like the Group to have a Walking Holiday next September? Any suggestions for a location would be appreciated.
								Please contact either Sue or Hilary asap as choosing an area, the right Hotel, the walks and leaders takes time. Please
								contact Sue Hill on 07730472606. email- susanmaryhill56@icloud.com Hilary Myers on 0114 2306604. email -
								hilarymyers16@gmail.com
								
								I'm looking forward to seeing you all again soon.

								CEDRIC ROBINSON THE QUEENS GUIDE OVER MORECAMBE BAY
							</div>
							<div class="card-body sviwg-ws-preline">
								Sadly Cedric, who was 88 years old, has passed away recently. Some of you will remember taking on this challenge during
								our 2015 holiday, organised by Steve Brown. Cedric was paid a mighty sum of £15 per year to take folks over these very
								dangerous sands.
								I was told that he went out the evening before to mark where the tide would come in the next day, as this changed every
								day. What fantastic knowledge to have, and to be so in touch with nature. I do hope Cedric has passed his knowledge on
								to another, so many more folks can continue to enjoy taking on this challenge.
