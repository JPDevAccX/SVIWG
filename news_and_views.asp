									At present the committee is:
									<section>
										<h3>Officers</h3>

											<li>Chair: Sue Hill</li>
											<li>Vice Chair: Martin Wing</li>
											<li>Treasurer: Stan Wainwright</li>
											<li>Secretary: Pauline Bullivant</li>
										</ul>
									</section>
									<section>
										<h3>Commmitee:</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Walk Coordinator: Eileen Ingham</li>
											<li>Newsletter Editor: Gail Fagan</li>
											<li>Committee Member: Hilary Myers</li>
										</ul>
									</section>
									<section>
										<h3>Co-opted members:</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Judith Morton</li>
											<li>Meg Patrick</li>
										</ul>
									</section>
								</p>
								<p>
									Stan is stepping down as Treasurer and Andy Abbey will take over as Treasurer.
								</p>
								<p>
									Pauline is also stepping down as Secretary so if anyone in our group would
									like to take over this role please contact Sue Hill.
								</p>
								<p>
									Darren Johnson will be on the committee as a co-opted member and David Guille as full member, his role being Health and Safety.
								</p>
								<p>
									Eileen is also willing to stand down as Walk Coordinator if anyone would like to take over from Eileen.<br>
									This role involves arranging with David the dates for his Tuesday walks (usually the first Tuesday in each month) and
									contacting walk leaders in our group or outside our group to see if they would
									be willing to lead a walk for the Wednesday and Sunday walks.<br>
									As walk coordinator, you do not have to know about the walks themselves as this is down to the walk leaders.<br>
									Please <a href="contact.asp">contact Eileen</a> if interested for further information.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also, if any members would like to be nominated for any of the above roles
									then please <a href="contact.asp">contact Sue</a>.<br>
									It would be good to see other new faces on our Committee.

							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<p>
									Many of you will remember Uriah as his role in Sheffield City Trust bequeathed to SVIWG Â£16,000 over four years.
									This occurred by his friendship with David Cadet.
								</p>
								<p>
									Last year he suffered a rare spine condition and is now in a wheelchair. He is having to learn to walk again.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also with his friendship with Darrell Lomas we have managed to gift him two Rubber Plants as a sign of our concern for him.
									He would like to thank SVIWG for their good wishes and David Cadet will keep us up to date with his progress.
									On behalf of the SVIWG I would like to send Uriah our very best wishes for a speedy recovery which I know he will succeed.
								</p>
								<p>
									Latest update on Uriah...He has now been commissioned as Chancellor at the Hallam University.<br>
									See this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20x07ql1n7o" target="_blank">BBC news article</a>
									and interview with Uriah.<br>
									His very positive attitude is inspiring.

								<p>
									Sometimes we have to turn down VI's if there are not enough guides for that particular walk.
									This is never personal - we are working hard to recruit new guides so our VI's are never turned down for a walk.
								</p>
								<p>
									Judith has set up a Facebook page for our group to send her any photos, videos, etc, hopefully to recruit new guides.
									Contact details are
									<a href="mailto:judemorton56@gmail.com">judemorton56@gmail.com</a> or
									mobile <a href="tel:07896 596413">07896 596413</a>.
									<br>
									Also not forgetting our web site managed by James Percival.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also it is most important to contact Martin by the date specified for that particular walk.
									This gives Martin time to try to find more guides to come along, sometimes forgetting to put their names down.
								</p>
								<p>
									Ideally we would like to have 2 guides for each VI but this is not possible so we always have 2 to 3 spare guides
									to give other guides who find themselves guiding most of the day a rest.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thank you for your cooperation.
