							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<p>
									It is very sad news that our friend Paul Foxton died Monday 5th August in hospital.
									This is a shock to our members who knew Paul as it happened so suddenly after his diagnosis of Lung Cancer.
								</p>
								<p>
									Paul was very popular in our group always cheerful and happy to be walking with us.
									He also loved his Pop quizzes acting as the Quizmaster asking group questions whenever we had time during a break
									and also entertaining the members on holiday whilst relaxing in the bar after their evening meal.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our condolences must go to his wife Carol, daughter Melanie and family,
									also his good friend David Cadet with whom they provided the group with Tuesday walks each month after
									thoroughly going out to check making sure they were fit for the group. 
								</p>
								<p>
									You will be very much missed Paul.

										My recollections of Paul was a gregarious, friendly and affable person who always had a smile on his face.
										</p>
										<p>
										He was full of enthusiasm for the group and devised along with David Cadet some very interesting and varied walks
										for the group which was a credit to both of them.<br>
										Not to forget Paul's love of quizzes he was such a nice man he will greatly be missed by all of us.
										</p>
										<p>
										 Rest in Peace old friend.

										Paul was my friend, I had known him since I became a Member Of SVIWG.
										</p>
										<p>
										This last couple of years, Paul and I spent a lot of time together planning and recceing Tuesday walks.
										Paul was always there when I needed him and nothing was ever too much trouble, for that I am eternally grateful.
										</p>
										<p>
										We shared some wonderful adventures and on the odd occasion we found ourselves saying "Where are we"?<br>
										We would have a laugh about it and Paul would say to me
										"David that's the reason why we recce walks, to find out if and where you go wrong."
										</p>
										<p>
										He wasn't just my friend, he was everyone's friend.<br>
										I will miss him. We will miss him, he was a fantastic walker and a wonderful sighted guide for all of our lovely VIPS.
										</p>
										<p>
										On behalf of all who knew him. R.I.P. Paul.

							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<b>Something Old, Something New, Experience by Carol Adams</b><br>
								<br>
								<p>
									I wouldn't say I'm scared, I wouldn't say I'm not.
									Memories of the past linger, rehearsing lines, adrenaline shot, I'm older now, my memory not what it used to be,
									Excitement in meeting new people, wondering what's next for me, It seemed so far off at first and then wow -
									So many more lines than I expected, right now.
								</p>
								<p>
									On reflection, I wonder if I'll learn them all in time,
									Something new to dive into, but oh, will I shine?
									Will I have to dance or sing, make the audience ring? It's a wedding scene, so will there be bling?
									A lot on my mind - can I still stand tall, After surgery, and pull it off at all?
								</p>
								<p>
									At first, I doubt myself, but then I take a stand, Rehearsals begin, lines spoken, all carefully planned.
									I hope to keep everything authentic and true, Looking forward to knowing my lines through and through,
									Then there are cues to remember, every one, How many times will I pour my soul into this run?
								</p>
								<p>
									Today is a day of rest, tomorrow's the final prep, Opening night looms and I've got one last step.
									We started in July, now the end is near, Just a week to go, and we'll give it all here,
									The stage is set, the people I've met - What will the critics say, what will we get?
								</p>
								<p>
									We hope for success in every show and pray for applause from row to row.
									I wonder about emotions, seeking approval high,
									The lines in my head, will they stick when I try?
									We all worry about missing a cue but the audience won't know, they haven't a clue.
								</p>
								<p>
									Here's just one song but I won't be the singer, My lines are rehearsed, I won't be a winger,
									I'm playing a registrar - does this role fit me? I'll give it my best and hope for victory.
								</p>
								<p>
									I'm so tired I could sleep for a week but I carry on, though rest seems bleak,
									The gym is my refuge at dawn's early light, Before trying to sleep, though it's still a fight.
								</p>
								<p>
									The dress rehearsal was a bit of a flop, Missing lines and prop mishaps that just won't stop,
									Are we ready for this, is time on our side? But then adrenaline kicks in and I'm along for the ride.
								</p>
								<p>
									The audiences are plenty, they clap as we leave, There's a buzz backstage, no time to grieve.
									At our first party, everyone craves more but there's still work to do, still things to explore.
								</p>
								<p>
									Every day's different, changes are made, Lines and scenes cut, to make the grade,
									Suddenly, confidence rises and I find my stride, It's a great show, with pride I confide.
								</p>
								<p>
									The audience laughs, and I make some cry, Despite any noise, we don't let it die,
									At last, it's here - we've made it through, Knowing 600 people have watched our debut.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now it's all over, no more lines to learn, We scream, shout, and take our turn,
									The adrenaline fades, and I finally sleep, With memories of this time, forever to keep.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks to all for their support - I'm worn out but proud, Proud I did it, that I made it, I say aloud,
									Proud of this unforgettable scene, Standing on stage, feeling serene, I owned it, just like the rest, That registrar role, I gave it my best.
