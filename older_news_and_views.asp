							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<p>
									Congratulations to Mike Jackson who has received an MBE in the new
									year's honours list for services to the community.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mike said one of his greatest privileges was joining the SVIWG soon after the group started,
									leading a Bi-monthly walk taking VI's to places we never dreamed of
									and indeed VI's who had been long time ramblers and lost their sight
									later in life they never thought it would be possible again.
								</p>
								<p>
									The	memorable ones like Kinder Scout, Bleaklow and leading a party up	Snowdon.
									Mike was a warden on Kinder and we always knew we	were in safe hands.
								</p>
								<p>
									Well-deserved Mike on behalf of the SVIWG.

									Thank you to all the members who have supported the Tuesday walks offered in 2023. It means a lot to us to have your

									will be longer than others but we feel it will be worthwhile.

									A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE - Guides and VIP's alike, who went on our six day holiday in Anglesey.
									You were Marvellous. We had six lovely HOT days away with great companions.
									A special thanks must go to the five lovely people, our friends from Wales, Margaret, Peter, Helen, Steff and Angie

									To Phil, our skilful Coach driver and friend, thank you for looking after us all so well, and getting us safely back each day.
									I'm looking forward to finding out what Margaret Patrick is planning for us next year in Northumberland.
									Thank you all for your support over the last 12 years of my arranging the groups walking holiday. My records show that the
									first time we met and were led by Margaret Norwood was on Tuesday 6th September in 2011.
									She led us on a 7 mile circular walk, from our Hotel in Betws-y-Coed.
