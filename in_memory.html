						</div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>
								I am very sorry to announce Gordon Worthington died Sunday 30th July at home with his family just after his 89th
								birthday.
								Gordon along with Jean joined our walking group just after it had started, and quickly got involved with the group.
								They started the fourth Sunday walk as we only had the Wednesday walk back then one walk per month and they were
								responsible for taking the group on their first holidays on public transport, not in the bespoke coach we have today.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first holiday being in the Isle of Wight with a coach company. Rod, who was with the group then, knew many walks
								around the Isle of Wight.
								After that, came two train trips to Teignmouth, and later in our cars to the Lake district.
								Gordon and Jean were also responsible for helping to set up the committee.
								Gordon was an excellent guide, becoming our No 1 guide. This was seconded by Betsy, which was praise indeed.
								His dedication to guiding and to the group was outstanding, and he always said he did not feel right unless he had
								someone to guide, he loved it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Gordon also loved his garden and spent the afternoons in there when at home. He had lots of bird feeders and said he
								had to fill them up twice a day.
								He had a very long garden which kept him very busy. He loved the social side of our group, although he was a quiet
								man, he had a great presence.
								Gordon and Jean were married for 65 years and were a truly devoted couple hardly ever to be seen without one another.
								On behalf of the SVIWG we send our condolences to Jean, daughter Jacqueline and son Peter, their Grandchildren and
								their Great Grandchild.
							</p>
							<p>
								So lovely to have known you Gordon.

										I would like to share a funny story about Gordon and myself.
									</p>
									<p>
										I had arranged to meet Jean and Gordon for a walk but for some reason Jean could not make it.
										It was just the two of us.
										We had a nice walk and finished in the cafe at Norfolk Park. The chef is my neighbour's father, so I know him.
										I said, "hello Andrew this is my friend Gordon", straight away he said, "nowt to do with me, nowt to do with me".
										I looked at Gordon and said, "he thinks we are having it off". How we laughed a lovely memory.
									</p>
									<p>
										RIP my lovely kind caring friend, you will be reunited with George, Betsy and our John B....

						</div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>
								Sadly Cedric, who was 88 years old, has passed away recently. Some of you will remember taking on this challenge
								during our 2015 holiday, organised by Steve Brown. Cedric was paid a mighty sum of Â£15 per year to take folks over these
								very dangerous sands.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was told that he went out the evening before to mark where the tide would come in the next day, as this changed
								every	day. What fantastic knowledge to have, and to be so in touch with nature. I do hope Cedric has passed his
								knowledge on to another, so many more folks can continue to enjoy taking on this challenge.
