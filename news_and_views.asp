								<p>
									David and Paul would like to thank all those members who came on the Tuesday walk on the 5th March.
									It was a fantastic turnout, there were 19 in total which is one of the highest we have had.
								</p>
								<p>
									There were eight VI's so we had enough guides.
									It was especially nice to see Mary and Ken.
								</p>
								<p>
									It was a nice day, the weather was kind, and although we had to change the walk due to the heavy rain we had just a few days before,
									it was a first Tuesday walk around Graves Park, Summerhouse and Cobnar Woods.

								<p>
									We are holding a training session, date not known yet, for any new guides wishing to come along.
									This is also open to any guides who have received training in the past but would like a refresher.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is a great opportunity as Alison Anthony who works as a Re-hab officer at Howden House is extremely qualified to give this training.
									Please put your name down with Sue - it would be good to see our new guides there.<br>
