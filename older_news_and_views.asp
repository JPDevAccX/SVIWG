								<p>
									Thank you to all the members who have supported the Tuesday walks offered in 2023. It means a lot to us to have your

									Plans for 2024 are already in progress, and we are hoping to branch out again as we did in 2023. This means journeys
									will be longer than others but we feel it will be worthwhile.

									Thank you again

									A BIG THANK YOU TO EVERYONE - Guides and VIP's alike, who went on our six day holiday in Anglesey.
									You were Marvellous. We had six lovely HOT days away with great companions.
									A special thanks must go to the five lovely people, our friends from Wales, Margaret, Peter, Helen, Steff and Angie
									who joined us and led us on different days, giving us six different and	interesting walks, we shall all remember.
								</p>
								<p>
									To Phil, our skilful Coach driver and friend, thank you for looking after us all so well, and getting us safely back each day.
									I'm looking forward to finding out what Margaret Patrick is planning for us next year in Northumberland.
									Thank	you all for your support over the last 12 years of my arranging the groups walking holiday. My records show that the
									first time we met and were led by Margaret Norwood was on Tuesday 6th September in 2011.
									She led us on a 7 mile circular	walk, from our Hotel in Betws-y-Coed.
