									It is very sad our former treasurer Stan Wainwright died recently.
								</p>
								<p>
									Stan was our treasurer for many years doing a brilliant job keeping meticulous records
									even when it was clear his health was suffering.
									We saw his decline over the last year but he always came to our Committee Meeting hardly ever missing.
								</p>
								<p>
									Stan walked with us in the beginning and attempted a few challenges with our group.
									He was also a keen Table Tennis player before his illness which he never spoke about.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our commiserations to his family and friends.
