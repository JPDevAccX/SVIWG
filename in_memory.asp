							<p>
							We are deeply sad to hear of the news of our friend and supporter Uriah Renee who died on the 8th June.
							</p>
							<p>
							Uriah suffered a rare neurological condition which left him paralysed from the waist down.
							</p>
							<p>
							His CV was outstanding living a very good life helping others and he had so much more to offer.
							</p>
							<p>
							Our thoughts to his family and his friends in our group David Cadet who had known Uriah when he was 15 years old
							and played in the football team that David was refereeing at the time and also Darrel Lomas who was his friend.
							</p>
							<p>
							He certainly left a mark on society and also our group it was a privilege to have known him.

								It is very sad news that our friend Paul Foxton died Monday 5th August in hospital.
								This is a shock to our members who knew Paul as it happened so suddenly after his diagnosis of Lung Cancer.
							</p>
							<p>
								Paul was very popular in our group always cheerful and happy to be walking with us.
								He also loved his Pop quizzes acting as the Quizmaster asking group questions whenever we had time during a break
								and also entertaining the members on holiday whilst relaxing in the bar after their evening meal.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our condolences must go to his wife Carol, daughter Melanie and family,
								also his good friend David Cadet with whom they provided the group with Tuesday walks each month after
								thoroughly going out to check making sure they were fit for the group. 
							</p>
							<p>
								You will be very much missed Paul.

									<p>
									He was full of enthusiasm for the group and devised along with David Cadet some very interesting and varied walks
									for the group which was a credit to both of them.<br>
									Not to forget Paul's love of quizzes he was such a nice man he will greatly be missed by all of us.

									Paul was my friend, I had known him since I became a Member Of SVIWG.
									</p>
									<p>
									This last couple of years, Paul and I spent a lot of time together planning and recceing Tuesday walks.
									Paul was always there when I needed him and nothing was ever too much trouble, for that I am eternally grateful.
									</p>
									<p>
									We shared some wonderful adventures and on the odd occasion we found ourselves saying "Where are we"?<br>
									We would have a laugh about it and Paul would say to me
									"David that's the reason why we recce walks, to find out if and where you go wrong."
									</p>
									<p>
									He wasn't just my friend, he was everyone's friend.<br>
									I will miss him. We will miss him, he was a fantastic walker and a wonderful sighted guide for all of our lovely VIPS.
									</p>
									<p>
									On behalf of all who knew him. R.I.P. Paul.

						</div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>
								I am very sorry to announce Gordon Worthington died Sunday 30th July at home with his family just after his 89th
								birthday.
								Gordon along with Jean joined our walking group just after it had started, and quickly got involved with the group.
								They started the fourth Sunday walk as we only had the Wednesday walk back then one walk per month and they were
								responsible for taking the group on their first holidays on public transport, not in the bespoke coach we have today.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first holiday being in the Isle of Wight with a coach company. Rod, who was with the group then, knew many walks
								around the Isle of Wight.
								After that, came two train trips to Teignmouth, and later in our cars to the Lake district.
								Gordon and Jean were also responsible for helping to set up the committee.
								Gordon was an excellent guide, becoming our No 1 guide. This was seconded by Betsy, which was praise indeed.
								His dedication to guiding and to the group was outstanding, and he always said he did not feel right unless he had
								someone to guide, he loved it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Gordon also loved his garden and spent the afternoons in there when at home. He had lots of bird feeders and said he
								had to fill them up twice a day.
								He had a very long garden which kept him very busy. He loved the social side of our group, although he was a quiet
								man, he had a great presence.
								Gordon and Jean were married for 65 years and were a truly devoted couple hardly ever to be seen without one another.
								On behalf of the SVIWG we send our condolences to Jean, daughter Jacqueline and son Peter, their Grandchildren and
								their Great Grandchild.
							</p>
							<p>
								So lovely to have known you Gordon.

										I would like to share a funny story about Gordon and myself.
									</p>
									<p>
										I had arranged to meet Jean and Gordon for a walk but for some reason Jean could not make it.
										It was just the two of us.
										We had a nice walk and finished in the cafe at Norfolk Park. The chef is my neighbour's father, so I know him.
										I said, "hello Andrew this is my friend Gordon", straight away he said, "nowt to do with me, nowt to do with me".
										I looked at Gordon and said, "he thinks we are having it off". How we laughed a lovely memory.
									</p>
									<p>
										RIP my lovely kind caring friend, you will be reunited with George, Betsy and our John B....

						</div>
						<div class="card-body">
							<p>
								Sadly Cedric, who was 88 years old, has passed away recently. Some of you will remember taking on this challenge
								during our 2015 holiday, organised by Steve Brown. Cedric was paid a mighty sum of Â£15 per year to take folks over these
								very dangerous sands.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was told that he went out the evening before to mark where the tide would come in the next day, as this changed
								every day. What fantastic knowledge to have, and to be so in touch with nature. I do hope Cedric has passed his
								knowledge on to another, so many more folks can continue to enjoy taking on this challenge.
