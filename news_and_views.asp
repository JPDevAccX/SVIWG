									There have been several unpleasant incidents near Poundland and the former Argos so for future walks
									the meeting point is the Cathedral.

									From David

								<p>
									Thank you to all the members who have supported the Tuesday walks since I was appointed as walk
									leader/organiser. It has been a pleasure this last 13 years and I hope that you have enjoyed the
									adventures as much as I have planning and leading them.
								</p>
								<p>
									It is time for a change and new leaders for Tuesday walks will begin in 2026. Please support them as
									you have supported me.
								</p>
								<p>
									The time has come for new adventures with new leaders accepting the responsibility of leading new
									walks. Thank you and I wish you all a very Happy Christmas and healthy and prosperous new year.

										<div class="card-body">
											<p>
												I am sure I speak for all our SVIWG members past and present that David has done a remarkable job
												over the years planning and leading Tuesday walks.
											</p>
											<p>
												His walks have been varied, and I cannot imagine all the planning and checking out all walks each
												month. It must have been like a full-time job.
											</p>
											<p>
												David will still be involved as you will see he has already set out plans acquiring walk leaders
												for next year.
											</p>
											<p>
												I do hope you will come on some of the walks David. Thank you very much for always sending me the
												walks in time for the newsletter.
