									A great success!
									Those of you who unfortunately couldn't make it missed a treat.
								</p>
								<p>
									The weather was kind, the garden was looking spectacular, and the atmosphere was very lively and upbeat.
									So thanks to Mike for being such a generous and enthusiastic host, he certainly kept us on our toes with the organisation.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thanks also to the members of the Abbeydale Rotary club for their generous support with advance publicity, practicalities and administration.
									Thank you to Mike's family and friends who helped on the day and to Nicola for her supreme efficiency in the kitchen.
									I've never seen anyone produce so many glasses of pimms so fast, with tea and coffee on the boil at the same time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Also thanks to everyone who contributed to the refreshments, I heard lots of appreciative compliments about the cakes.
									Finally, thank you to everyone who attended and made the afternoon such a convivial gathering, it was a really feel-good event.
								</p>
								<p>
									We made a profit of just over Â£500, a fantastic result.

							</div>
							<div class="card-body">
								<p>
								We are deeply sad to hear of the news of our friend and supporter Uriah Renee who died on the 8th June.
								</p>
								<p>
								Uriah suffered a rare neurological condition which left him paralysed from the waist down.
								</p>
								<p>
								His CV was outstanding living a very good life helping others and he had so much more to offer.
								</p>
								<p>
								Our thoughts to his family and his friends in our group David Cadet who had known Uriah when he was 15 years old
								and played in the football team that David was refereeing at the time and also Darrel Lomas who was his friend.
								</p>
								<p>
								He certainly left a mark on society and also our group it was a privilege to have known him.
