							</div>

								<p>
									<b>Sheffield Royal Society for the Blind</b> (SRSB) is one of Sheffield's oldest independent charities,
									with a rich history dating back to 1860.
								</p>
								<p>
									The charity was founded by Eliza Harrison in memory of her sister Ann who had empathy for blind people.
									Their primary aim was to provide opportunities and support and employment for blind individuals.
									Their first workshops opened on the 17th September 1860 on West Street, marking the beginning of the charity.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Harrison sisters lived in Weston House (now Weston Park Museum) with their father.
									Upon selling this to the council, they were provided with the money to set up SRSB.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<b>1879</b> The school for the blind opened on Manchester Road.
											This school was later attended by Lord David Blunkett.
										</li>
										<li><b>1899</b> Overend cottages are opened in Crosspool providing independent living for blind people.</li>
										<li><b>1935</b> Cairn Home opens in Crosspool.</li>
										<li><b>1939</b> The Mappin Street building opens, providing a hub for entertainment.</li>
										<li><b>2009</b> A new building was built replacing the old one.</li>
										<li><b>2017</b> SRSB extends its services to Rotherham as Rotherham Sight and Sound (RSS).</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Today the SRSB and RSS continue to provide support and friendship
									to folks in the Sheffield and Rotherham areas.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Royal National Institute of Blind People</b> (RNIB) is a national charity which also
									provides outstanding support for blind and partially sighted people.
									Many people think we are the same charity and we often receive donations made out to RNIB.
									In-fact, like Guide Dogs or Deaf Blind UK, we are all quite separate.
