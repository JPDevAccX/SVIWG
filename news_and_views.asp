								<p>
									We are sorry to inform you that our friend Derek Taylor died early October.
								</p>
								<p>
									Derek was around at the beginning of SVIWG and remained a constant coming each Wednesday without fail.
									Derek was also a great sportsman loving cricket and playing at a high level
									also running the Sheffield half marathon each year.
									Derek was very smart and when he was not in walking clothes he was to be seen around always in a suit.
								</p>
								<p>
									He lost his wife two years ago after years of marriage and we could see his decline from there.
									When he was no longer able to walk with us he always came to our social events
									the last being at our AGM this year.
								</p>
								<p>
									Our condolences to his two sons and their families
									also his Grandchildren whom he adored and this was also the same for them.
								</p>
								<p>
									We will miss you Derek. Thank you for many years of support. Gail.
								</p>
								<p>
									Derek's funeral is to be held Hutcliffe Wood 31st October at 3.30pm.
								</p>
