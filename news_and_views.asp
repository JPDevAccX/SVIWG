								<p>
									David Cadet has been doing the Tuesday walks for many years they have become
									very popular with the most attendance of all our walks.
								</p>
								<p>
									David would like to step down from this role or perhaps have some help
									with someone taking over some of them.
									Please contact Eileen as we do not want to lose this very popular walking day.
								</p>
								<p>
									David has been remarkable with his work producing a walk monthly it is not easy as walk leaders
									will acknowledge the work that goes into checking out walks etc.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thank you for any interest.

								<p>
									It is very sad to let you know that Melvin Oughton died in September.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mel as he was known was very popular.
									He was Deaf Blind but extremely independent until his eyesight became much worse
									and he could no longer remain independent.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mel enjoyed lots of exotic holidays this being possible with Travel-eyes which was set up
									for blind folks which they provided a sighted companion for these holidays.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mel was a successful business man in his working life a credit due to his dual disabilities.
								</p>
								<p>
									He attended the Maude Maxfield school for the deaf in Sheffield. 
									From there he met his great friend Phillip Timms and when together on a walk
									they reverted back to their schooldays being very mischievous.
								</p>
								<p>
									Mel was a very quietly spoken gentle person and he will be missed by our group.
								</p>
								<p>
									On behalf of the SVIWG I would like to send our condolences to his family and also Phillip.
									His funeral is at City Road on Wednesday 1st October 1.45pm afterwards at the Angel PH Woodhouse.
								</p>
