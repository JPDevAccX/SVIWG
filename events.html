								WALKS ON GROUP HOLIDAY - 5th September 2023
							</div>
							<div class="card-body sviwg-ws-preline">
								<i><b>Dear all, Margaret Norwood has sent me the following information.
								Please have a look at it and let me know your thoughts. Regards Hilary</b></i>

								You gave me details of the mileages that you wanted but no mention of the hills! The Anglesey Coast Path has some lovely	stretches but many of them include hills.
								
								There would be walks for both groups on the island making use of the coach to get to the start of the walks.
								Also, I	have found some nice short walks from the hotel though neither are on the flat all the way.
								I went over to Bangor to find your hotel, right on the end of the pier (nice cafe at the end).
								I spoke to a very friendly receptionist and she	suggested several outings.
								
								Are members also members of the National Trust? There are two stately homes with gardens nearby, for instance, Penrhyn Castle and Plas Newydd on Anglesey.
								If you google them you can see for yourself. They would be suitable for the short	walk group, and some of the others may be interested as well.
								
								Would you still like a mountain walk? There are plenty of walks in the Bethesda area if you can make use of the coach.
								The last time you were here we walked from Ogwen down to Bethesda on an old coach road and ended at the zip wire.
								Although, no one took advantage of the facility but you did need to book in advance - good excuse?
								I have "recruited" four friends who all know Anglesey better than I do and they have "volunteered" to lead walks for both groups.
								If the small group set off with the rest, but wanted to cut the walk short, there is quite a good bus service back to Bangor.
								I	shall put together a programme of walks flexible enough to suit the weather forecast. We had to make some changes last time didn't we!
								
								Would you want to walk every day or do you plan other activities in the area? We are all four years older than the last	time so we must make allowances for that!
								I have slowed down a lot but still I'm so glad that I can still get out and	climb a few hills ..... but slowly!!

								DONATED CLOTHING UPDATE

								I would like to apologise if the wrong message was conveyed about walking equipment.

								I don't have the capacity at home to store items and it's not possible for me to carry home donated items, or carry the item to a walk to hand it over.
								If you have any item(s), please contact me by text, email or phone call - I will keep a list of items and make it known in the newsletter.
								If you would like any of the items, let me know and I can put you in touch with the person donating, to make arrangements.
								Any new member who requests items before they decide if the group is for them and no longer come then we would request these items to be returned back to the group.

								Hope this clears any ambiguity.

								SIGHTED GUIDE TRAINING VIDEOS - HOW TO GUIDE A BLIND PERSON
							</div>
							<div class="card-body sviwg-ws-preline">
								Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/-jqepQ8yASM">link to a video</a> showing how to guide a VI person - it will help our new guides, also well practiced members and also VI's.
								It is by Amar Latif who founded the company Traveleyes which specialises in holidays for VI's.
								I think it is extremely good, so perhaps members would like to take a look.
